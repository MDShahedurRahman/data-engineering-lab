# Data Engineering Labs

This repository contains hands-on data engineering labs focused on building, processing, and managing data pipelines using modern tools and best practices.

## Overview

The goal of these labs is to strengthen practical data engineering skills, including:
- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Data storage
- Batch and streaming processing
- Working with distributed systems

Each lab is designed to be simple, incremental, and easy to understand.
